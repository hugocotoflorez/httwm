# ***Httwm*** (Hugo's Tty Tiling Window Manager)

## About

F\*ck Xorg, F\*ck buggy Wayland!! Wellcome back TTY

## Usage

Log in tty and run httwm. Just as simple, don't fuck
you mind display-ing stuff. If it's not made by 7-color
chars it is over-bloated.

## About development

Now you can create a pseudo terminal and see it from the
parent terminal. You can run commands *and vim too*.

## Testing

Looks like pseudo terminal works perfectly. Thanks chatty
for contributions.
